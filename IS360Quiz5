Reading Quiz: “Tidy Data”
1. Data Tidying is what Hadley Wickham calls structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

2. In tidy data, there are three properties. One of these properties states that “each type of 
observational unit forms a table.” What are the other two properties of tidy data.
1) Each variable forms a column
2) Each observation forms a row


3. According to Hadley Wickham, what are the five most common problems with messy datasets?
1) Column headers are values, not variable names
2) multiple variables are stored in one column
3) variables are stored in both rows and columns
4) multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table
5) a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables

4. Provide a one sentence definition for each of the four fundamental verbs of data manipulation:
a. Filter - To subset or removing observations from a set based on some condition
b. Transform - To add or modify variables, involving either a single variable or multiple variables
c. Aggregate - To collapse multiple values into a single value
d. Sort - To change the order of observations

5. What is the function in base R used for filtering? 
The subset() function is one way to filter data, and he also mentions the transform() function

Reading Quiz: “Introduction to dplyr”
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the dplyr package versus the plyr package?
+ Dplyr is much faster
+ Provides a better thought out set of joins
- Only provides tools for working with data frames

2. What are the advantages and disadvantage of using plyr versus the base R apply family of 
functions?
+ Much more consistent and functions have the same interface, so it is easier to master many
- Centered around data frames, does not work with vectors

Reading Quiz: “tidyr”
1. What are the two verbs (functions) in the tidyr package that correspond to the spreadsheet 
functions pivot and unpivot?
pivot is gather()
unpivotr is spread()
